I have responsibility for market development (go to market and sales) across all of the EBA ventures Globally for Cognizant's High Tech, Communication, Entertainment and Media verticals. Similar to a corporate venture capital or incubation model, the EBA makes investments in three areas. First, are investments in new markets. These involve adapting Cognizant’s global delivery model around existing offerings to serve new industries, including targeted areas of the public sector and new geographies. Second, are investments in services around the new IT architecture, namely SMAC (social, mobile, analytics and cloud). SMAC related service offerings have now been sold to 60% of the top 100 customers. And third, are investments in new delivery models, primarily nonlinear models that are based on proprietary intellectual property and allow Cognizant to decouple revenue and headcount. These include investments in platform-based, business process software, and a multi-tenant technology platform to process clients' transactions. These were recently launched as the Cognizant BusinessCloud for clients wanting to leverage an on demand model in the cloud. Two BusinessCloud solutions have been highlighted on CTSH earnings calls including a digital asset management platform (AssetSERV), and a heterogeneous cloud management platform (Cloud 360). 

I also sell a diverse portfolio of Analytical tools which will allow for companies and individuals to leverage "Code Halos". Code Halos are made up of the data that accumulates around people, devices and organizations that's robust, powerful and rich with meaning and insight.
